# Subgroup Prediction Shiny App (proof-of-concept)

This repository contains the code for a proof-of-concept R Shiny app discussed in [Detection of differential depressive symptom patterns in a cohort of perinatal women: an exploratory factor analysis using a robust statistics approach](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eclinm.2023.101830).

<span style=color:red>**Note:**</span> Parameters used by this prediction calculator were estimated from a sample of postpartum women who had a history of major depressive disorder, were actively seeking psychiatric care, and predominately identified as White and non-Hispanic. Before this tool could be recommended clinically, parameter estimates should be obtained from a large, representative sample of perinatal women.

The R Shiny app can be accessed [here](http://knieser.shinyapps.io/app_subgrouppredict).
